# Architecture Review: Salesforce-Notion Sync

## Current Approach Issues

### 1. Transaction Limitations
- Flow-triggered Apex runs in the same transaction as the DML operation
- External API calls (Notion API) within transactions cause:
  - 10-second callout timeout limit
  - Maximum 100 callouts per transaction
  - Transaction lock issues
  - Poor user experience (UI freezes)

### 2. Governor Limits Risk
- Multiple API calls for relationship handling
- Heap size limitations with large data
- CPU time limits when processing complex relationships

### 3. Error Handling Challenges
- API failures would rollback entire transaction
- No built-in retry mechanism
- Difficult to handle partial failures

## Recommended Architecture: Event-Driven Asynchronous Processing

### Platform Event + Queueable Apex Pattern

```
[Record Change] → [Flow] → [Platform Event] → [Event Subscriber] → [Queueable Apex] → [Notion API]
```

### Benefits:
1. **Decoupled Architecture**
   - UI operations complete immediately
   - Background processing for API calls
   - No transaction blocking

2. **Scalability**
   - Handle bulk operations efficiently
   - Process records in batches
   - Chain Queueable jobs for large datasets

3. **Reliability**
   - Built-in retry mechanism
   - Error isolation
   - Audit trail through platform events

4. **Governor Limit Compliance**
   - Separate transaction contexts
   - Unlimited callout time in async
   - Better resource utilization

### Implementation Components:

1. **Platform Event**: `Notion_Sync_Event__e`
   - Record IDs
   - Object Type
   - Operation Type (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
   - Retry Count

2. **Event Subscriber**: Apex Trigger on Platform Event
   - Enqueue Queueable jobs
   - Group records by object type

3. **Queueable Apex**: `NotionSyncQueueable`
   - Process records in batches
   - Handle API calls
   - Chain for continuation

4. **Error Handling**: `Notion_Sync_Log__c` Custom Object
   - Track sync status
   - Store error details
   - Enable manual retry

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

1. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**
   - Pros: Native Salesforce feature, automatic change tracking
   - Cons: Limited control, requires additional configuration

2. **@future Methods**
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: No chaining, limited error handling, 50 calls limit

3. **Batch Apex**
   - Pros: Good for large volumes
   - Cons: Not real-time, minimum 1-minute delay

## Recommendation
Implement Platform Event + Queueable Apex pattern for optimal balance of:
- Real-time processing
- Scalability
- Error handling
- User experience
- Maintainability
